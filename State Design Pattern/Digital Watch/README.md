# Digital Watch  

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>  
<p>A simple digital watch has a ‘display time’ state, ‘set hours’ state and ‘set minutes’ state. It has two buttons, button A and B. When the watch is in ‘display time’ state and button A is pressed then it goes to ‘set hours’ state. If the watch is in ‘set hours’ state and button A is pressed then it goes to ‘set minutes’ state. 
When the watch is in ‘display time’ state and button B is pressed there is no change in the state of the watch. When the watch is in ‘set hours’ state and button B is pressed, then the hour value in the display advances and the watch remains in the same state. When the watch is in ‘set minutes’ state and button B is pressed, then the minute value in the display advances and the watch remains in the same state. The initial state of the watch is ‘display time’ state.</p>
