# Copying Machine  

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>  
<p>A Copy machine has display panel, ready light. When the power is OFF the machine is in OFF state. When the power is on the machine, the machine goes to warming state. During warming state, the ‘ready light’ starts flashing. After doing the initial checks, the machine goes to ready state. When it is in ready state, the ready light is turned ‘on’, and it displays the number of copies as one and size as normal on the display panel. If the size and the no of copies are changed, the machine still remains in the same state. When a start button is pushed, the machine goes to copying state. Copying proceeds until all copies are complete. After this the machine goes into the ready state.</p>
