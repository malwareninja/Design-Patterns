# Defect Tracking System  

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>  
<p>A software tester enters a defect in a Defect Tracking system (DTS). When this happens, the defect goes into a state ‘available’. Now, a software developer can acquire the ‘available’ defect. When the developer acquires this defect, it is goes from ‘available’ state to ‘In Progress’ state and that developer is called owner of the defect. Now no other developer can acquire it. Owner keeps working on ‘In progress’ defect. Once the defect is fixed ie the solution is found, it goes from ‘ in progress’ state to the ‘Ready for review’ state. Reviewer reviews the solution of ‘ready for review’ defect. If reviewer is satisfied about solution, the defect goes to the state ‘Resolved’ else it goes to the ‘available’ state.</p>
